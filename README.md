# Aliens have crashed on Earth
## A Mod for Unciv

This is an overpowered joke nation.

**Currently this is not 100% compatible with the main Unciv master code**
Reason: this is using a zip file for the images, zipped relative to the folder it is in - this will be unzipped to the mod folder by yairm210/master, but handled correctly by [SomeTroglodyte/ModManager-tweaks](https://github.com/SomeTroglodyte/Unciv/tree/ModManager-tweaks). The mod should be playable as long as the desktopl launcher does not try to repack textures.  

Note the mod contains music and a json using code that has not made it into Unciv - this is ignored with the current code base, but you could go and sustitute the default `music/thatched-villagers.mp3` with `https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/mp3-royaltyfree/Elf%20Meditation.mp3` to get part of the intended experience.
